//Using the principle of TDD and the node modules "chai" and "mocha" complete the following exercises:

Given an array of integers, write a function that returns the largest integer in that array. 

Given a string, write a function that returns the number of time the letter "b", "c" or "u" appear in that string.

Write a JavaScript program check if a given positive number is a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 7. The function should return true or false (a boolean).

Write a Javascript program that console.logs all the properties in an object. 

//You don't need to write tests for the following exercises:

Build an express server and serve an html file that displays the current year. Using the Web Console, console.log() the current day of the week as an intege
of 0-6 where 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, ... 6=Saturday.


Next week we'll be doing more with Javascript Objects and having multiple Javascript Objects working with each other. It's important to be comfortable
with the concept of "scope." Watch some videos (I'd be happy to recommend some), read some articles (I'd be happy to recommend some), and most importantly,
when you're trying to learn objects and scope, WRITE SOME CODE USING THEM!!! WOOHOO!! Remember, you guys can run any javascript with node. The power is yours!

Thanks guys! 

See you on Monday!
